<h2>Side Projects</h2>
<h3>Parallel Processing</h3>
	<p>Parallel Processing was a course offered at my university that, due to scheduling, I was unable to take. However, my
		curiosity in this relevant topic led me to independently dabble in this field. The Parallel Processing professor
		was helpful in providing me with the course reading materials and was available for questions. My GitHub account 
		contains a <a href="https://github.com/mateamilojkovic/parallelProcessing"><u>repository</u></a> with the code I've created 
		in my journey of understanding a little bit more of the complexities of parallel computing.</p>
		
<h3>Data Mining</h3>
	 <p>In today's Information Age, data is plentiful but often mysterious. <i>Data Mining</i> and <i>Visualization</i>
		 are vital in order to make sense of and understand data. Under the guidance of two professors (one Computer Science
		 and one Business Analytics), I and another student took an independent study course in Data Mining. I presented the 
		 cumulation of our work at the 2018 Symposium on Data Science & Statistics. Our research abstract and presentation can 
		 be found on the conference's 
		 <a href="http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2018/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?AbstractID=304729"> <u>online 
		  program</u></a>. If you would like a copy of the R Script we used for our analysis, please 
		 <a href="mailto:milojkovicm2@winthrop.edu"><u>email</u></a> me.</p>
