        		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p style="font-size: 20px"><i>Growing up, many children dream about becoming nurses, police officers, or 
			firefighters. I wanted to be a ninja. </i>Night of the Ninjas<i>— the fifth book in the series <i>
				The Magic Tree House</i>— sparked my desire to utilize stealth and cunning to bring the “bad guys” to
			justice. Over the years my career goals have slightly changed: 
			although I have come to realize my ninja-career may not be attainable, I still look forward to participating in 
			a fast-paced industry.</i></p>

			<p style="font-size: 20px">I never quite know how to answer the question "Where are you from?" Do I say Serbia 
		         and Croatia, where my parents immigrated from? Do I say Vancouver, British Columbia, where I was born? Do I 
			 say South Carolina, where I grew up? Do I say Texas, where I'll be working after graduation? Because of my
			 background, I truly feel like a global citizen: the world is my backyard and everyone in it my neighbor.
			 If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I love to travel (I mean, 
			 I need to explore my whole backyard). To check out a few of my favorite "backyards", check out my travel page!</p>
			
			<h4> <i> Education </i> </h4>
			
			<p style="font-size: 20px">I was homeschooled from the fourth grade until the end of high school. I'm so thankful
			for this because it allowed me to dig deeper into my studies (like taking Algebra I in 7th grade and 
			dual credit classes my last two years of high school) while exploring extracurricular activities (like acting,
			food blogging, and tennis). Homeschooling also cultivated in me a curiosity to understand the "why" behind
			every and anything. I attribute my time management and research skills to my homeschooling as well: my "I don't
			know but I can find out" attitude was strengthed through my nontraditional education.</p>
		
			<p style="font-size: 20px">I currently attend Winthrop University as a Computer Science and Accounting double
			major. Fitting these two areas of study into four years while being active in on-campus organizations has 
			definitely had its difficulties. I almost dropped out of a few organizations in the fall of 2017 when I took
			10 courses, was heavily involved in 3 organizations, and worked as a peer tutor. About a month into the semester,
			I realized I needed to either drop something off my plate or magically make an eight day in the week to catch up
			on homework. Instead, I took advice I had heard from multiple people I looked up to: plan your day and work your
			plan. To keep my sanity, I started planning my week to the minute. <i> 6AM: wake up. 6:15AM: breakfast. 6:30AM:
			homework for ACCT 509...</i> and so it went, typically till around 11PM. Thanks to my planner and sheer 
			determination, I was able to continue my participation in extracurricular activities, finish my semester on the 
			Presidents List, and keep my sanity entact. </p>
			
			<h4> <i> Future Plans </i> </h4>

			
			<p style="font-size: 20px">After graduating in May 2019, I look forward to beginning my career at KPMG in Houston,
			Texas as a Deal Advisory associate, specifically on the data team. After interning at KPMG this past summer (Summer
			2018), I was able to work on accounting teams and data teams on projects like mergers and acquistions, initial 
			public offerings, and carve-outs. I found my background in accounting and computer science was best utilized on
			the data team and I'm excited to work on the team full-time next summer. </p>
			
			<p style="font-size: 20px">I created this site for a few different reasons. One was to learn more about website
			design and the back-end enviroment. Another was to showcase myself: who I am, my accomplishments, and my goals.
			So please, look around and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments!</p>
