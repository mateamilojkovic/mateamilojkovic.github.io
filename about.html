        		<h1>Matea Milojkovic</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 20px"><i>Growing up, many children dream about becoming nurses, police officers, or 
					firefighters. I wanted to be a ninja. </i>Night of the Ninjas<i>— the fifth book in the series
					The Magic Tree House— sparked my desire to utilize stealth and cunning to bring the “bad guys” to
					justice. Over the years my career goals have slightly changed and my aspirations have matured: 
					I still look forward to engaging in a fast-paced industry.</i></p>
			
			<p style="font-size: 20px">I never quite know how to answer the question "Where are you from?" Do I say Serbia 
		         and Croatia, where my parents immigranted from? Do I say Vancouver, British Columbia, where I was born? Do I 
			 say South Carolina, where I grew up? Do I say Texas, where I'll be working after graduation? Because of my
			 background, I truly feel like a global citizen: the world is my backyard and everyone in it my neighbor.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size: 20px">I was homeschooled from the fourth grade until the end of high school. I'm so thankful
			for this because it allowed me to dig deeper into my studies (like taking Algebra 1 in 7th grade and 
			dual credit classes my last two years of high school) while exploring extracurricular activities (like acting,
			food blogging, and tennis). Homeschooling also cultivated in me a curiosity to understand the "why" behind
			every and anything. I attribute my time management and research skills to my homeschooling as well: my "I don't
			know but I can find out" attitude was strengthed through my nontraditional education.</p>
		
			<p style="font-size: 20px">I currently attend Winthrop University as a Computer Science and Accounting double
			major. Fitting these two areas of study into four years while being active in on-campus organizations has 
			definitely had its difficulties. I almost dropped out of a few organizations in the fall of 2017 when I took
			10 courses, was heavily involved in 3 organizations, and worked as a peer tutor. About a month into the semester,
			I realized I needed to either drop something off my plate or magically make an eight day in the week to catch up
			on homework. Instead, I took advice I had heard from multiple people I looked up to: plan your day and work your
			plan. To keep my sanity, I started planning my week to the minute. <i> 6AM: wake up. 6:15AM: breakfast. 6:30AM:
			homework for ACCT 509...</i> and so it went, typically till around 11PM. </p>
