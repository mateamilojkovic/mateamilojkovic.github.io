<h1>About Me</h1>
   <p style="font-size: 20px"><i>Growing up, many children dream about becoming nurses, police officers, or firefighters. I wanted to 
	   be a ninja. </i>Night of the Ninjas<i>— the fifth book in the series </i>The Magic Tree House<i>— sparked my desire to 
	   utilize stealth and cunning to bring the “bad guys” to justice. Over the years my career goals have (slightly) changed but 
	   I still look forward to participating in a fast-paced industry.</i></p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px">I never quite know how to answer the question "Where are you from?" Do I say Serbia and Croatia, where
	      my parents immigrated from? Do I say Vancouver, British Columbia, where I was born? Do I say South Carolina, where I grew 
	      up? Do I say Texas, where I'll be working after graduation? Because of my background, I truly feel like a global citizen: 
	      the world is my backyard and everyone in it my neighbor. If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I love 
	      to travel. To see a few of my favorite "backyards", check out my

<h2> <i> Education </i> </h2>
			
	<p style="font-size: 20px">I was homeschooled from the fourth grade until the end of high school. I'm so thankful for this 
		because it allowed me to dig deeper into my studies (like taking Algebra I in 7th grade and dual credit classes my last 
		two years of high school) while exploring extracurricular activities (like acting, food blogging, and tennis). 
		Homeschooling also cultivated in me a curiosity to understand the "why" behind every- and any-thing. I attribute my 
		time management and research skills to my homeschooling as well: my "I might not know but I can find out" attitude was 
		strengthed through my nontraditional education.</p>
		
	 <p style="font-size: 20px">I currently attend Winthrop University as a Computer Science and Accounting double major. Fitting 
		 these two areas of study into four years while being active in on-campus organizations has definitely had its 
		 difficulties. I had to seriously re-evaluate my goals when I spread myself a little too thin in the fall of 2017 when 
		 I took 10 courses, was heavily involved in 3 organizations, and worked as a peer tutor. About a month into the semester,
		 I realized I needed to either drop something off my plate or magically make an eight day in the week to catch up on 
		 homework. Instead, I took advice I had heard from multiple people I looked up to: plan your day and work your plan. 
		 To keep my sanity, I started planning my week to the minute. <i> 5:50AM: wake up. 6:00AM: breakfast. 6:15AM: homework 
		 for ACCT 509...</i> and so it went, typically till around 11PM. Thanks to my planner and sheer determination, I was 
		 able to continue my participation in extracurricular activities, finish my semester on the Presidents List, and keep 
		 my sanity entact. </p>
			
<h2> <i> Future Plans </i> </h2>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">After graduating in May 2019, I look forward to beginning my career at KPMG in Houston, Texas as a 
		Deal Advisory associate on the data team. After interning at KPMG this past summer (Summer 2018), I was able to work on 
		accounting teams and data teams on projects like mergers and acquistions, initial public offerings, and carve-outs. My 
		KPMG mentor and I found my background in accounting and computer science was best utilized on the data team and I'm 
		excited to work on the team full-time next summer. </p>
   
	 <p style="font-size: 20px">I created this site for a few different reasons. One was to learn more about website design and the 
		 backend environment. Another was to showcase myself: who I am, my accomplishments, and my goals. So please, look around
		 and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments!</p>
