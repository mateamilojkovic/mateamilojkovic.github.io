		 <h4><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> by Dale Carnegie</h4>
		 <p> <img src="mateamilojkovic.github.io/pictures/books/howtowinfriendsandinfluencepeople.jpg" class = "left"
		       width = 150px height =200px >
                Growing up, I was very shy and introverted. When my parents <s>forced</s> encouraged me to read Dale Carnegie's book, 
                 I learned techniques on how to handle arguments, put people at ease, and search for things to compliment people on.
                 Throughout my highschool and college years, I've utilized the principles from this book (the importance of appreciation and 
		 geninue smiles, ways to persuade people, and point out another's mistake, just to name a few). This is definitely a 
	         book worth re-reading again and again! </p>

                <h4><i>Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future</i> by John MacCormick</h4>
		<p><img src="mateamilojkovic.github.io/pictures/books/nineAlgorithms.jpg" class = "right" width = 150px height =200px>
                I'm the student who combs professors' bookshelves for good reads. I found this book one my professor's desk one day
		and was intrigued by it. I pestered him to finish reading it so I could borrow it. I was surprised by how simply the book
		explained complex topics. Of particular interest to me where the chapters on PageRank, forward error correction, and 
		pattern recognition. PageRank is the algorithm used by Google Search to determine how to display search results. Forward
		error correction deals with the issue of handling errors in data transmission over unreliable communication channels. 
		Lastly, pattern recognition is closely related to artifical intelligence and machine learning; it allows machines
		to recognize patterns and similarities in data. This book is a great read for both the computer science nerd and anyone
		interested in learning about influencial alogrithms in layman terms.</p>

		<h4><i> The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</i> by Stephen Covey</h4>
		<p><img src="mateamilojkovic.github.io/pictures/books/7habits.jpg" class = "left" width = 150px height =200px>
                 Looking to increase your productivity, tap in to the synergy that comes from working on teams, or improve 
		 a skill set? I attribute much of my development of a "go-getter" attitude from Stephen Covey's book. This book
		 taught me, one habit at a time, how to take action (independence), work well with others (interdependence), and
		 balance and renew my mentality (continuous improvement). </p>
